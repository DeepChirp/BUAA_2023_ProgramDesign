## 题目描述

“第18号十四行诗”是莎士比亚最著名的十四行诗之一，全文如下：

    Shall I compare thee to a summer's day?
    Thou art more lovely and more temperate:
    Rough winds do shake the darling buds of May,
    And summer's lease hath all too short a date;
    Sometime too hot the eye of heaven shines,
    And often is his gold complexion dimm'd;
    And every fair from fair sometime declines,
    By chance or nature's changing course untrimm'd;
    But thy eternal summer shall not fade,
    Nor lose possession of that fair thou ow'st;
    Nor shall death brag thou wander'st in his shade,
    When in eternal lines to time thou grow'st:
        So long as men can breathe or eyes can see,
        So long lives this, and this gives life to thee.
